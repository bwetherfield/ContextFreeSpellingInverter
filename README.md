# ContextFreeSpellingInverter

`ContextFreeSpellingInverter` is a simple tool that takes spelled musical intervals as input and outputs a set of spelling preferences for use in my pitch spelling algorithm (as devised in my Harvard undergrad thesis and implemented in [bwetherfield/PitchSpeller](https://github.com/bwetherfield/PitchSpeller)).

## Roadmap

For the timebeing, `ContextFreeSpellingInverter` spits out a JSON file containing the derived preferences.
